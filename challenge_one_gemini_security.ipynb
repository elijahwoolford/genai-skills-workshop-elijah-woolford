        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates comprehensive security measures for a Gemini-powered recipe chatbot, implementing multiple layers of protection against prompt injection, jailbreaks, and unsafe content.\n",

        "## Key Technologies\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Gemini 2.5 Pro** for recipe generation with built-in safety filters\n",
        "- **Gemini 2.5 Flash** for fast input validation (guard model)\n",
        "- **Google Model Armor API** for prompt injection and jailbreak detection\n",
        "- **System Instructions** for strict topic enforcement (recipe-only)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Architecture Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Input Validation**: Model Armor scans user prompts for injection/jailbreak attempts\n",
        "2. **Topic Filtering**: Guard model ensures queries are recipe-related\n",
        "3. **Safe Generation**: Gemini generates recipes with safety settings enabled\n",
        "4. **Response Validation**: Validate Gemini safety ratings before returning responses\n",
        "5. **Output Filtering**: Model Armor scans responses for policy violations\n",

            "*   1 small shallot, finely chopped\n",
            "*   2 cloves garlic, minced\n",
            "*   1 cup (200g) Arborio rice\n",
            "*   1/4 cup dry white wine (like Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio)\n",
            "*   2 tbsp nutritional yeast\n",

            "1.  In a medium saucepan, bring the vegetable broth to a simmer over low heat. Keep it warm throughout the cooking process.\n",
            "2.  In a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil and 1 tablespoon of vegan butter over medium heat. Add the sliced mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until they have released their liquid and are nicely browned (about 5–7 minutes). Season with a pinch of salt and pepper.\n",
            "3.  Add the chopped shallot to the pot and cook for 2–3 minutes until softened and translucent. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.\n",
            "4.  Add the Arborio rice to the pot. Stir constantly for about 1 minute to toast the grains and coat them in the oil.\n",
            "5.  Pour in the white wine and stir until it is completely absorbed by the rice.\n",
            "6.  Add one ladleful (about 1/2 cup) of the warm vegetable broth to the rice. Stir gently and continuously until the liquid is almost fully absorbed.\n",
            "7.  Continue adding the broth one ladleful at a time, allowing each addition to be absorbed before adding the next. Keep stirring frequently. This process should take about 18–20 minutes.\n",
            "8.  After about 18 minutes, start tasting the rice. It is done when it's creamy and tender but still has a slight chew (al dente). You may not need all of the broth.\n",
            "9.  Remove the pot from the heat. Stir in the nutritional yeast, the remaining tablespoon of vegan butter (if using), and the fresh parsley.\n",
            "10. Season generously with salt and black pepper to taste. The risotto should have a fluid, creamy consistency. Serve immediately.\n",

Strain the mushrooms (reserving the flavorful liquid), chop them, and add them to the pan with the fresh mushrooms. Add the reserved mushroom liquid to your vegetable broth.\n",
